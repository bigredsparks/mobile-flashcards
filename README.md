Project: Mobile-Flashcards

This project was created for Udacity ReactJS Nano-Degree Course.  This is the 3rd and final project which focuses on
mobile application development using React Native.

This application was developed using an Android emulator running in GenyMotion.  It was not tested for the ios platform.

To run:
- Download all the project dependencies by running: `yarn install`
- Run the project using: `yarn start`
- Launch Android emulator (GenyMotion) on local system.
- Select 'a' to connect to emulator

Caveat: Accessing permissions to get notifications does not work well within the emulator.  The code implemented follows
the exact example shown in class.  The notification is reset whenever a quiz is taken.
